# When we multiply 0.1 with 3 in python, it doesn't print "Stop the first stage!" because 0.1*3 gives us 0.30000000000000004 in python.
# This is due to round-off errors.
# This program is calculating the distance traveled based on the input value/current increment. The program will tell you when distance reaches 0.3 km (First stop) and 0.4 km (Second stop).
